A weekly survey was used in a 100-level Chemistry course to support student engagement in
self-regulated learning and metacognitive reflection. The survey asked students to reflect on
their learning, engage in planning, and report confidence on specific course topics. We
examined the relationship between student success, confidence on topics, and their selfregulating
behaviors. We find that a majority of students (67%) accurately self-assed their
abilities, with a relationship between exam grades and confidence. In addition, we identify a
minority of students who exhibit the Dunning-Kruger effect, overestimating their ability, not
seeking help, and performing poorly on exams. Case studies were used to describe how student
confidence and performance related to engagement in metacognitive activities. Our analyses
have potential to impact the design of interventions related to self-regulation and metacognition
and to better understand studentsâ€™ self regulation.
